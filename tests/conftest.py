"""Shared test setup.

The breaker conformance suite (``tests/conformance/test_breaker_contract.py``) is
copied verbatim from the canonical repo and hashed by ``core/VERSION``, so it must
not name any one package. It resolves ``breaker``/``errors``/``state`` from the
``core_pkg`` fixture below (and its spawned multiprocess workers import the same
package by the path passed through their arguments, ``core_pkg.__name__``)."""
